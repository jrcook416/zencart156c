<b>The new Pulmodyne GO-PAP comes with an included nebulizer-  a MedSource (Part MS-303) branded nebulizer  (Picture attached BadNebulizer.jpg).

This MedSource nebulizer does not work very well, or at all. The cup will not reliably stay connected to the Nebulizer Port in the GO-PAP. Effective immediately Please do not attempt to use the MedSource branded nebulizer included in the packaging with the CPAP.

The Individually packaged curaplex branded Small Volume Nebulizer (REF 301-201) issued by IEMS will work and stay in place in the GO-PAP nebulizer port as expected. 

Until Further Notice: Please use the curaplex nebulizers instead of the neb provided with the CPAP. 

The DISS adaptor for O2 connection and tubing works as intended and can be used to supply oxygen for the curaplex branded Small Volume Nebulizer

We have contacted the manufacturer and they are taking steps to correct this situation.

Please contact me directly with any questions
