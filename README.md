Zen Cart&reg; v156c for Indianapolis EMS Logistics
---------------------
Zen Cart&reg; v156c branches for Indianapolis EMS Logistics correspond to the subdirectory-specific instance for each serviced agency type OR the function of the branch.  The agency-specific branches contain the same code that the **master** and **dev-local** branches have - this is an artifact of how the site was built prior to Git version control and its implementation.  All site changes should be coded in **dev-local** on a suitable development machine, verified for consistency and function on the same development machine, then **dev-local** on the development machine should be pushed to the **dev-local** branch on GitHub, then marged into **master**. From **master** on GitHub, the changes should be merged into the individual site branches on GitHub and then pulled into the branches on the production environment. **At no time should untested or unverified changes be pulled into the production environment**.  Note that there are independent template files for each agency-specific site in all branches - this is so a new site or replacement site can be created by cloning the **master** repository into a new directory, creating a new template set and configuration files, and testing the new site.


The specific branches are as follows: 
1. **master** - This branch contains the master code base for v156c. It should contain the most recent and stable changes for the software across the site.  
2. **dev-local** - This branch contains code that is under development for release to the master branch and subsequent merge/push to the site-specific branch.
3. **external** - This branch is checked out on the External Agency site.
4. **iems** - This branch is checked out on the Indianapolis EMS agency site.
5. **ifd** - This branch is checked out on the Indianapolis Fire Department agency site.
6. **leo** - This branch is checked out on the Law Enforcement Agencies site.
7. **wayne** - This branch is checked out on the Wayne Township agency site. 

This README.md document should exist in each branch - each individual README.md document should highlight the specific branch that the document is located in, and specific Markdown documents should be created to illustrate site-specific needs in configuration, data design, or operation.

Compatibility
-------------
Zen Cart v1.5.6 is designed for:
 * PHP 5.6 to PHP 7.3 (it "can" work on PHP 5.5, but you really should use a newer version)
 * Apache 2.2 and 2.4
 * MySQL 5.1 to 5.7 (including MariaDB 10.0 to 10.3)


Installation
------------

Installation is simple:

1. [Download Zen Cart&reg;](http://sourceforge.net/projects/zencart/files)
2. Ensure you check that the md5/sha1 hash of the Zip matches those publicly posted.
  * The md5/sha1 values for verifying the zip files hosted at Sourceforge are displayed on the [Zen Cart&reg; website](https://www.zen-cart.com/) along with [instructions on how to verify the file using the hash values](https://www.zen-cart.com/content.php?305).
3. Unzip the downloaded zip file 
4. Everything inside the folder you unzipped needs to be uploaded to your webserver â€¦ for example, into your `public_html` or `www` or `html` folder (the folder will already exist on your webserver)
5. In your browser, enter the address to your site, such as: `www.example.com` (or if you uploaded it into another subdirectory such as `foldername` use `www.example.com/foldername`)
6. Rename the `/includes/dist-configure.php` and `/admin/includes/dist-configure.php` files to "`configure.php`" and make the files writable (so the install process can write your configuration information into them after you answer a few questions in the following steps).
7. Also make the `/cache` and `/logs` folders writable. (You will be prompted about making other folders writable during installation)
8. Follow the instructions that appear in your browser for installation. 

If some of the terms used in these brief instructions are things you don't understand, there is a much more detailed set of instructions in the [/docs/Implementation-Guide](https://www.zen-cart.com/docs/implementation-guide-v156.pdf) PDF.
